# QueryLens: RAG Based Chat Application
QueryLens is an AI-powered tool that revolutionizes how developers/configurators interact with and understand documentations.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for QueryLens, a RAG-based chat application for document interaction, came from observing the challenges faced by professionals across industries when working with extensive and complex documentation:

1. Configuration Complexity : Users often struggle to find precise answers to their configuration-related queries when navigating through lengthy manuals, guides, or technical documents.A chatbot tailored for documentation allows users to ask specific questions and receive instant, accurate answers without having to comb through pages of text.

2. Streamlining Workflows: Configuring components based on technical or setup documents often requires users to follow detailed instructions spread across multiple sections. This tool can create an interactive flow to help users configure components efficiently by guiding them step-by-step and providing contextual information directly from the document.

3. Time Efficiency: Manually searching for the right information within large documents can be tedious and time-consuming, especially when deadlines are tight.QueryLens significantly reduces time spent searching by offering on-demand, conversational access to document knowledge.

4. Critical Information Extraction: Users may overlook important configurations or miss essential details when trying to digest dense documentation.QueryLens ensures critical configurations and key insights are easily surfaced and highlighted during interactions, improving accuracy and productivity.

5. Personalized Assistance: Users can interact conversationally with the document, asking tailored questions and receiving responses specific to their needs. This makes the documentation more accessible and approachable, even for users with less technical expertise.
